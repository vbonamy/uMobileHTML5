uMobileHTML5 - Test Application
============================

WARN : At the moment, the purpose of this app is just testing what we can do on a full HTML5 + JQuery Mobile App with uPortal.

You can embed this like a mobile app with phonegap for example.

But you can also simply test it with a HTML5 Browser compliant like Chrome :
chromium-browser --disable-web-security index.html
